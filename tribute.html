        <h3>Just who is that glorious man riding on a horse?</h3>
        <p>Madison Bumgarner is a professional baseball pitcher for the San Francisco Giants of Major League Baseball. He has been a lynch pin for the Giants domination in 2010 and onward where he helped the ballclub win 3 World Series. Most notably was his last WS performance in 2014 where he came in as a relief pitcher in game 7 and essentially shut down the Kansas City Royals in their own stadium to collect their most recent trophy. Another unique thing about the Southpaw is that not only does he dominate as a pitcher, but he also can hit for power, collecting 11 career homeruns (5 of which came from last season 2015). Despite all his recent accolades, the hard throwing, snot firing, horse riding, beer chugging southpaw is only 26 and is just entering his prime.</p>
